# Automate Testing with Playwright + TypeScript

**This repository** is an **Automate Testing** implementation created as part of my **portfolio**. This project uses **Playwright** and **TypeScript** to perform end-to-end tests on the **Swag Labs** demo website ([https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)). Additionally, the test results are automatically updated into a **Google Sheet** for tracking and management.

If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to reach out to me 🙇🏻‍♀️. I’m always open to feedback and improvements! 💖

## About the Project

- **Framework:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for better code management and developer experience
- **Test Target:** Swag Labs demo website ([https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/))
- **Result Logging:** Test results are automatically updated in a shared Google Sheet (link below)

## How It Works ❓

1. **Write Test Cases**: Automate interactions on the Swag Labs website using Playwright.
2. **Run Tests**: Simulate user behavior to validate features and ensure reliability.
3. **Log Results**: Automatically update the test results into Google Sheets for easy tracking.
